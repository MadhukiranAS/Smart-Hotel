# Smart-Hotel
Hi guys..I am interested to implement a project on managing the orders payments and other works for a remote hotel from anywhere using GPS.
My scratch idea is
1.Turn on the GPS
2.search nearby hotels
3.get the information about menu card
4.view feedbacks about the hotel
5.calculate the required distance from current location to the destination(hotel)
6.pay the bill online and reach the hotel in given time and have food
